PQIV README

WHY NOT USE QIV?

qiv (http://www.klografx.net/qiv/index2.html) is a great image viewer, but it
does not use gtk2 but imlib for image handling. This is bad, because many
distributions (well, at least gentoo) do not offer this library anymore as it's
quite old and not maintained anymore.


ABOUT PQIV

When the first release of pqiv was written, I used python, hence the name. I
expected somebody else to write a c-rewrite of qiv, so I didn't really care
about that. About one month later nothing had happened yet, so I did this on my
own. Starting from 0.4 pqiv means "pretty quick image viewer", written in pure
c, using gtk+-2.0.

Now the program is more or less feature complete. If you miss something either
look for one of those big image viewers or pass me an email.


FEATURES

Thanks to Rene Saarsoo <nene ät triin döt net>, who suggested nearly all of the
new 0.4 features. He also implemented most of them into the old python code,
so ask him if you're interested in another python'ish version.

Features include:
 * Fullscreen
 * Slideshow
 * Rotate / Flip
 * (Automatic/manual) Zoom
 * Move by drag & drop in fullscreen
 * Keep preferences in a configuration file
 * Rather small executable (~28k), low ram consumtion, quick
 * Execute predefined commands


INSTALLATION

Usual stuff. make && make install
You'll need
 * gtk+-2.0
 * gthread-2.0
 * pango
 * glib
All of those libs are included in the gtk+-2.0 package.


KNOWN PROBLEMS

* Some window managers, especially Beryl, have problems with many commands in
  short intervals. As a resize follows the unfullscreen command immediately,
  the main window could be too big/small upon the unfullscreen command


CHANGELOG

pqiv 0.4
 * Source rewritten into c
 * Mouse moves image in fullscreen
 * Configuration file
 * Many bugfixes (i.e. fullscreen on startup)

pqiv <0.4:
 See the old python release for information on that
