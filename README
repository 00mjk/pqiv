PQIV README

WHY NOT USE QIV?

qiv (http://www.klografx.net/qiv/index2.html) is a great image viewer, but it
does not use gtk2 but imlib for image handling. This is bad, because many
distributions (well, at least gentoo) do not offer this library anymore as it's
quite old and not maintained anymore.


ABOUT PQIV

When the first release of pqiv was written, I used python, hence the name. I
expected somebody else to write a c-rewrite of qiv, so I didn't really care
about that. About one month later nothing happened yet, so I did this on my
own. Starting from 0.4 pqiv means "pretty quick image viewer", written in pure
c, using gtk+-2.0.

Now the program is more or less feature complete. If you miss something either
look for one of those big image viewers or pass me an email.


FEATURES

Thanks to Rene Saarsoo <nene ät triin döt net>, who suggested nearly all of the
new 0.4 features. He also implemented most of them into the old python code,
so ask him if you're interested in another python'ish version.

Features include:
 * Fullscreen
 * Slideshow
 * Rotate / Flip
 * (Automatic/manual) Zoom
 * Move by drag & drop in fullscreen
 * Keep preferences in a configuration file
 * Rather small executable (~28k), low ram consumtion, quick


INSTALLATION

Usual stuff. make && make install
You'll need
 * gtk+-2.0
 * gthread-2.0
 * pango
 * glib
All of those libs are included in the gtk+-2.0 package.
