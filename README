PQIV README

pqiv is a python rewrite of qiv. It's far from beeing complete but all
major features are working. I wrote it because my favorite distribution
gentoo dropped support for qiv. This script might be inefficient; to tell the
truth, it's more like "quick and dirty".

This package does not come with a Makefile as it's intended as a sourcefile for
the ebuild only. Anyway, if you downloaded it on your own, installation is
simple:
 * Copy pqiv.py to /usr/bin/qiv
 * Copy qiv.1 to /usr/share/man/man1/qiv.1 (optional)
You'll need pygtk.
