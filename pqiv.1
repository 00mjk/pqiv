.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "pqiv" [options] <file(s) or folder(s)>
.SH DESCRIPTION
pqiv is a simple image viewer inspired by qiv.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -a, --keyboard-alias=nf
Define n as a keyboard alias for f. For example, `-a af' will give you fullscreen with the `a' key.
.TP
.B -c, --transparent-background
Borderless transparent window. Click on the window to show the window borders,
click again to hide them.  This will only work in compositing window managers.
.TP
.B -d, --slideshow-interval=n
Set the interval for the slideshow mode
.TP
.B -f, --fullscreen
Start in fullscreen mode
.TP 
.B -i, --hide-info-box
Initially hide the info box
.TP
.B -n, --sort
Sort files in natural order
.TP
.B -P, --window-position=POSITION
Set initial window position. Use `x,y' to position the window at the specific
coordinates, or `off' to not position the window at all. The default behavior
is to center the window.
.TP
.B -R, --reverse-cursor-keys
Reverse the meaning of the cursor keys
.TP
.B -s, --slideshow
Initially activate slideshow mode
.TP
.B -t, --scale-images-up
Scale images up to fill the whole screen
.TP
.B -T, --window-title=TITLE
Set the title of the window. You have some variables available:

.po 7

.TP
.I $BASEFILENAME
The base file name of the current file (e.g. `image.png')

.TP
.I $FILENAME
The file name of the current file (e.g. `/home/user/image.png')

.TP
.I $WIDTH
The width of the current image in pixels

.TP
.I $HEIGHT
The height of the current image in pixels

.TP
.I $ZOOM
The current zoom level

.TP
.I $IMAGE_NUMBER
The index of the current image

.TP
.I $IMAGE_COUNT
The total numer of images

.po 0

The default is `pqiv: $FILENAME ($WIDTHx$HEIGHT) $ZOOM% [$IMAGE_NUMBER/$IMAGE_COUNT]'

.TP
.B -z, --zoom-level=FLOAT
Set initial zoom level as a floating point number (1.0 is 100%)
.TP
.B -1, --command-1=COMMAND
Bind the external COMMAND to key 1. Likewise, you can use -2 to -9 for those keys.
Extended usage:

.po 7

.TP
.I Show command output in a window
Prefix the command with 
.RI `>'
to display it's output in an overlay window.

.TP
.I Pipe the image through a filter
Prefix the command with 
.RI `|' 
to write the image to the program's stdin and read an image from its stdout.
The output is not cached, so reloading the image will revert to the old state.

.po 0

.TP
.B --disable-scaling
Disable scaling of images
.TP
.B --shuffle
Shuffle files

.PP
You can use the file
.RI ~/.pqivrc
to make any of there default. The file's syntax is (mostly) those of desktop-files. Create a section
.I options
and use the long option names for the key names. For example,

.po 5

[options]
.br
fullscreen=1
.br
slideshow-interval=5

.po 0

would be a valid configuration file.  
The old syntax from pqiv <= 0.13, where the file was prepended to the argument
vector, is still supported, but limited in that in new versions of pqiv,
doubling an option will no longer revert its effect. So if you have `-f' in
your configuration file, another `-f' on the command line will no longer
unfullscreen pqiv. Migrate to the new syntax if you want to regain this
possibility.

.PP
pqiv will display all files you specified on the command line. Directories will
be searched recursively for files supported by gtk+
(for example: bmp, gif, jpeg, png, wbmp, xpm, svg). The special file
.B -
will cause pqiv to read a file from stdin.

.SH USAGE
In pqiv, you can use both mouse and keyboard to navigate through the images. Execute
.B "pqiv" -h
to get more information on the key bindings.
